#Quiz-WebApp
A full-stack web application that allows users to take randomized quizzes based on selected topics. Built with PHP, MySQL, and HTML/CSS, the app dynamically generates a 10-question quiz from a database and provides immediate feedback with visual indicators for correct and incorrect answers. It also tracks and stores user scores for future reference.
